                        <p>Our users want to donate to charity, but have a lack of knowledge on the charities themselves
                            and unsure of how to start donating. Our solution will provide users with a way to easily find
                            and learn about the charities that they are interested in, and have payment options that would
                            work for them.

                        My team and I used Google Jam Board to construct our affinity diagram which encompasses all the ideas we were able to think of for our project.
